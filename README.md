# Calculator
A calculator written in React JS that can operate basic arithmetics.

## How to use the program
Enter any sequence of numbers and operations and hit equal to calculate the sequence. The possible operations are division, multiplication, subtraction, and addition. If the sequence includes a combination of operations (e.g. 6 + 3 x 12), the calculator will follow BEDMAS and execute multiplication and division first before addition and subtraction.

Other buttons:
- AC: clears the current input
- DEL: deletes the most recent input
